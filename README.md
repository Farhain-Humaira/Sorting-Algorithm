# Sorting-Algorithm

A sorting algorithm is a method used to arrange items in a list or array in a specific order, like from smallest to largest or alphabetically. It uses rules to decide how to reorder the items. 

- For example, if you have a list of numbers, a sorting algorithm will help you put them in ascending order so that they are organized from the smallest number to the largest.
